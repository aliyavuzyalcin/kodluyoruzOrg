# Object Oriented Programming

## What is OOP?

-   Object Oriented Programming is a programming approach based on the concept of **classes and objects**. The purpose of this approach is to divide the needed program into smaller parts and make it manageable and reusable. Each small piece has its own characteristic, data, and information on how to communicate with other small pieces.

-   In OOP, programs are designed so that objects interact with each other. We somehow model *real-life* complexity so that the computer understands it. Modeling is an ancient method that people have used to solve problems. Instead of trying to visualize and solve a big problem in mind, the appearance, behavior of the target system, or in some cases, the reactions of the target system can be observed on the model or models to be created.

-   With Object Oriented Programming, we model everything we will do in a way that the computer can understand and transfer it as an "object". In this way, we make the objects that are valid for us in real life so that computers can understand them. Of course, within the possibilities given to us by the programming language used. Thus, a language-independent agreement, a philosophy, emerges between the coder and the computer. Now what the "car" object means to us, it means the same to the computer.

-   OOP is a fast and easy to implement approach.

-   OOP provides a clear structure for programs.

-   OOP implements the "Don't Repeat Yourself" principle and makes code easy to maintain, edit and debug.

-   OOP makes it possible to build reusable applications with less code and shorter development time.

-   OOP provides extensibility by adding new features to the build later on.

-   OOP models problems in terms of real-life processes.
