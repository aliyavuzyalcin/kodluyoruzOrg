# Modeling & Abstraction

-   In order to solve real-life problems in the virtual environment of the computer, the problem must first be transferred to the computer environment appropriately. This process is called “abstraction” or “modeling”.

-   An ancient method that people have used to solve problems. Instead of trying to visualize and solve a big problem in mind, the appearance, behavior of the target system, or in some cases, the reactions of the target system can be observed on the model or models to be created.

-   The model can be created to understand or describe an existing or planned system and is used effectively in many different areas. For example, a construction company that wants to promote a mass housing construction to its customers prepares models or models that visually express the layout, color and relative sizes of the buildings. A person who examines this model can evaluate by seeing where the house he wants to buy is, its proximity to the school building or how it is accessed to the main road. Here, the model is a mock-up and fulfills the purpose of "describing the target system".

-   Multiple models can be created for a system. Instead of trying to see the whole system with a single model, models that highlight different aspects of the system being studied can be prepared. For example, while the construction company prepares a model with an aesthetic design to explain the mass housing to its customers, it prepares different projects for the electrical installation of the buildings in this mass housing project, different for the water installation, and different projects for the general apartment appearance. Thus, people who are interested in different aspects of the same system have the opportunity to work on the model that highlights only the aspect that interests them.

-   The model does not necessarily have to be tangible either. Various models can also be created by computer simulation. For example, an airplane can be modeled with a computer simulation developed to study the movement of an airplane in the air. By playing with parameters such as wing length or fuselage tilt, it can be tried to understand how the aircraft will behave in different weather conditions. Here is a model created in a virtual environment to understand the behavior of the system.
