# **Basic Student Portal**

I created three class; ***Student, Course and Teacher***.

***Student class*** creates student object. 

- A student would take courses during the term. To be able to pass the classes student took, student must provide enough grades, such as his/her grades must be greater than 55 so that student can pass the course.

***Course class*** creates course object.

-  A course should have name, code(i.e. 101), prefix, grades and teacher.

***Teacher class*** creates teacher object.

-   A teacher would teach courses and would have his/her name, phone number and branch.
