# Classes and Objects

## What is object ?

Let's check what definitions the dictionary gives;

-   *noun* ** a solid thing that you can hold, touch, or see but that is not alive.

-   *nominative or indicative complement complementing the transitive verb. In this sentence; ***Ali bought a book*** , the book is the object.*

Examples for objects;

> Car, phone, apple, duck, pencil etc..

As we know, every object has its own attributes and behaviors. Objects are different from each other and behave according to their own existence and have their own identity.

### **Attribute**

The concept of ***attribute*** is the properties of an object and describes the current state of the object. For example, the color and weight of a duck are the characteristics of that duck. The color of one of our ducks is black, the color of the other duck is white. In this case, both ***objects (i.e. ducks)*** are **independent** of each other due to their attributes.

### **Behavior**

The actions that an object performs for itself. Again, if we look at the example of a duck, one duck can fly while another duck cannot fly due to its physical condition.

> Another thing we need to know about objects is that objects are a noun. Objects have their own attributes and behaviors.


## What is class ?

**OOP** is built on *classes* and *objects*, **"Classes"** are constructs or guides used to abstract and generalize a problem. Classes contain all the properties of an object. These properties determine what kind of attributes and behaviors the object will have.

*For example*, **"Car"** is a **class**. **Attributes of cars are color, speed, number of gears, fuel type, etc.** There can be many attributes. In addition, there may be behaviors specific to some cars, cars may **also have specific behaviors such as parking sensors, autopilot, cruise control.** When making a car, a *building manual* is needed. In programming, *these guides* are called **"Class"**.
